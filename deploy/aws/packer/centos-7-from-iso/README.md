# Packer Instructions


## Local Hypervisor build
Originally intended to provide a fast local PC build (not AWS). However seems slower than AWS (maybe vbox use of NAT networking and port forward for SSH). 

Needed this build for ISO installation to vbox OVF.

Currently supported hypervisors :
- vbox
